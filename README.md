# ConjugacyClassClusterer
The ConjugacyClassClusterer library provides a flexible generic implementation of the notion of mathematical conjugacy classes of objects. 

The conjugacy class mechanism provides an easy method to implement flexible clustering algorithms (one simply needs to define a similarity measure on the object type in question) based on a critical underlying mathematical concept. Moreover, this library's definition of similarity measures is flexible enough to allow clustering mechanisms which are more generous than would be strictly defined by any mathematical equivalence relation. Classes need not be well-defined conjuacy classes - the programmer may define similarity relations which depend on insertion order or other heuristics in determining to which class any new object is added.
